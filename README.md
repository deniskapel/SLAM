# This is the project for the Linguistic Data: Quantitative Analysis and Visualisation: computational linguistics course.

The project is aimed to analyse the data collected for the [2018 Duolingo Shared Task on Second Language Acquisition Modeling (SLAM)](http://sharedtask.duolingo.com/2018) challenge organised by Duolingo AI in conjunction with the 13th BEA Workshop and NAACL-HLT 2018 conference. One of the key findings of the challenge was the fact that a choice of a learning algorithm (for the task) appears to be more important than clever feature engineering.

This project for the Linguistic Data: Quantitative Analysis and Visualisation course is aimed to explore if any available or synthesised feature has any influence on making an error during the process of SLA and thus be used to predict potential errors. The Null Hypothesis Significance Testing framework will be used for analysis.
